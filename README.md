# TrashTag
TrashTag is a Platform that helps Manufacturers, Stores and Users to stop littering by incentivizing garbage disposal
This was a project built for the IIT Roorkee and Codingal App Challenge. It was built in a single Day and hence I couldn't make a very good looking app like some of my other flutter apps. This project will see updates soon
